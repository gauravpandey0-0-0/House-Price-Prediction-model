# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting house prices using three different algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression** - A simple, interpretable baseline model
2. **Random Forest Regressor** - An ensemble method that handles non-linear relationships
